1. How many floating operations are being performed in the matrix addition kernel?
  Floating operations = None.<br>
  Integer operations = Row calculation, Column calculation, Index calculation, and Addition each.

2. How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel?
  Global memory reads = 3 * n * n = 3 * 512 * 512 = 786432

3. How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel?
  Global memory writes = n * n = 512 * 512 = 262144.
