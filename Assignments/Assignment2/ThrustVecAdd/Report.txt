We have implemented the function in the template.cu file. The screenshot of the execution is included.
Only for the second element in the vector the generated data and the expected data are not matching (as shown in the screenshot).

Questions:
1. How many floating operations are being performed in your vector add kernel?
      2 * VECTOR_SIZE operations (one for addition of each element of the vectors, and the other for the iterator).

2. How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel?
      2 * (VECTOR_SIZE + 1) reads (for each vector, 1 to load the size of vector and VECTOR_SIZE operations to load the entire vector).

3. How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel?
      VECTOR_SIZE writes (for the output vector)

4. In what ways did Thrust make developing a functional vector addition code easier or harder?
      1. It was east to use once we get to know its functions
      2. It has optimally implemented code for high performance in GPU
