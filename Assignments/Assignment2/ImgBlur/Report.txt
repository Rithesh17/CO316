We have implemented the function in the "template.cu" file. The generated file is stored in the "convoluted.ppm" file.
Screenshot of the execution is not included as the output is evident from the "convoluted.ppm" file.

Questions:

1. How many floating operations are being performed in your color conversion kernel?
    Around 9 * imageWidth * imageHeight operations(each pixel has 9 neighbours (including itself), and so the sum is added 9 times (except for the corner pixels)).

2. How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel?
    Around 9 * imageWidth * imageHeight reads (each pixel has 9 neighbours (including itself), and so is loaded 9 times (except for the corner pixels)).

3. How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel?
    imageWidth * imageHeight writes (for the output image)

4. Describe what possible optimizations can be implemented to your kernel to achieve a performance speedup.
    The load operations can be greatly reduced if coded optimally. This is because we are loading the same pixel 9 times, which is heavily redundant.
